# About Us
UNISEC-SAR is a local chapter of UNISEC-Global. UNISEC-Global's primary objective is to help create a world where space science and technology is used by individuals and institutions in every country, rich or poor, and offers opportunities across the whole structure of society - whether academic, industrial or educational - for peaceful purposes and for the benefit of humankind.

UNISEC-Global is an international nonprofit body, consisting of local-chapters across the world. Since its establishment in November 2013 in Japan, UNISEC-Global has provided a forum every year to promote practical space development activities, mainly at university level, such as designing, developing, manufacturing, launching and operating micro/nano/pico satellites and rockets, including their payloads. University students, young researchers, their tutors and other stakeholders around the world participate in the annual UNISEC-Global Meeting. We have an average of more than 130 participants from about 33 countries in each meeting.
